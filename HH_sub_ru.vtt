00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:38.706
Давным давно был светящийся город, что за золотыми воротами,

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:40.540
называли его Рай.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.543
Им управляли существа из чистого света,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:47.089
Ангелы, что служили добру и оберегали всех ото зла.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.425
Одним из тех ангелов был Люцифер,

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:54.804
мечтатель с фантастическими идеями для воплощения,

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:57.849
но Старейшины Рая называли его помехой.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.562
Они считали, что его образ мышления опасен для мира созданного ими.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:07.276
So he watched as the angels
began to expand the universe in their ways.

00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:11.030
From the dust of Earth,
they created Adam and Lilith.

00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.783
Equals as the first of mankind,
but despite this,

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:19.413
Adam demanded control and
Lilith refused to submit to his will.

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:20.498
She fled the garden.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:23.291
Drawn in by her fierce
independence,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:29.297
Lucifer found her and the two
rebellious dreamers fell deeply in love.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:33.802
Together, they wished to share
the magic of free will with humanity,

00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:38.599
offering the fruit of knowledge to
Adam's new bride, Eve, who gladly accepted.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.476
But this gift came with a
curse.

00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:46.190
For with this single act of disobedience,
evil finally found its way into Earth.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.359
With it, a new realm of
darkness and sin.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.446
And the order Heaven had
worked to maintain was shattered.

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:55.573
As punishment for their
reckless act,

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:59.202
Heaven cast Lucifer and
his love into the dark pit he had created,

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.832
never allowing him to see the
good that came from humanity,

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.750
only the cruel and the wicked.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.255
Ashamed, Lucifer lost
his will to dream.

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:13.029
But Lilith thrived,
empowering demon-kind with her voice

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.554
and her songs. And as the numbers of Hell grew,

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:18.138
so did its power.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.811
Threatened by this,
Heaven made a truly heartless decision.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.355
That every year,
they would send down an army,

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:32.611
an extermination to ensure Hell and
its sinners could never rise against them.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.364
But Lilith's hope remained.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.368
And her dream was passed down
to their precious daughter

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.288
the Princess of Hell.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:46.750
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll make you proud.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.586
{n8}Charlie?

00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:51.630
{n8}Augh! Oh, shit. Did you hear
all that?

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.756
{n8}Uh... Yeah, I was right there.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:58.470
{n8}Sorry. I get pretty worked up
after an extermination happens.

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:00.680
This story helps.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.851
I know. Don't worry.
I enjoy your theatrics.

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:05.643
Are you okay?

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.606
I'm fine, just... thinking
ya know, family stuff.

00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:10.900
{n8}Did you hear
from your mom yet?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.569
{n8}Oof. How long has it been now?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.908
{n8}Not that long, only... seven...
years...

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.951
Off doing something
important, I'm sure.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:24.914
But this kingdom was something
she really cared about.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.748
Something I care about.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.334
Well, at least you aren't alone.

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.962
I just hope what
I'm trying to do here will work.

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.924
It will. I have faith in you.

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.258
All right. Come on.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.859
Alastor says he has
something to show us.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.436
Well, hello there you wayward sinner.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:51.565
Do you like blood,
violence and depravity of a sexual nature?

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:54.151
Of course you do.
That's why you're in Hell!

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:56.736
But what would you say

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.281
there was a place to stay that
had none of that?

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:01.783
Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel,

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:03.785
a misguided path to redemption!

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.497
Founded five days ago by
Lucifer's delusional daughter

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:08.831
Charlotte Morningstar!

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.626
Come place your
fate in her inexperienced hands

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:15.047
as she tries to work through
her daddy issues by fixing you!

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:18.049
{n8} Here, we offer fun things!

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.343
Such as somewhat
functional staff!

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.637
And 24 hour Pest Control!

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:26.725
Custom rooms,
and just look at this tacky parlor!

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:30.813
Enjoy riveting conversation
with our singular resident.

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:34.316
Wow! All this and more at the
Hazbin Hotel!

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.320
{n8}Your last desperate
attempt at salvation starts here.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.323
So, what'd ya' think?

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.076
I'm sorry, what the
fuck was that?

00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:46.286
Uh, yeah, one note...

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.496
Alastor, I mean...

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:53.836
First off, thank you so much
for making this seriously amazing,

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:57.673
but um... maybe the tone is a
bit...

00:04:58.382 --> 00:04:59.799
off?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.844
We want people to want to come
here,

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:05.264
this makes it look...
ummm...

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.350
Bad. The word
you're looking for is bad.

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.852
Funny. I was going
for hilarious!

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:13.897
It didn't explain anything
about how we're trying to save

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:16.942
demons from extermination,
which is the whole fucking point.

00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:19.610
Vaggie is right, Alastor.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.656
The commercial was to let
Sinners know we are trying to help them.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.951
Well, my dear, I haven't
been active in Hell for some time,

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:28.871
and everyone remembers me
from my radio show!

00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:32.415
The proper medium to
express oneself!

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:36.378
But you insisted on this: noisy
picture box advertisement,

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.712
So I had a little fun with it.

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.422
Oh, fun. You had a little fun
with it?

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.257
Well, this is not what we want
to represent us.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.093
When you showed up here a week
ago, you told us

00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:44.928
you would help
run this hotel!

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:46.763
Instead, you're mocking us.

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:48.765
Nobody's going to want to
come to a place

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:51.393
that a powerful Overlord like
you thinks is a waste of time!

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:54.562
What?

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.981
If'n ya filmin' a
commercial,

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:59.400
can I suggest you take
better advantage

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:03.217
of the talented
celebrity you have right here?

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:07.033
- Angel, you're a porn star.
- A famous porn star.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:12.790
I'll have the horniest sinners
knockin' these walls down to get in.

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:15.542
We are not filming a
porn as a commercial.

00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:18.419
Why not?
Sex sells, don't it?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.717
I swear if you film me goin' at
it with mister fancy talk-creepy voice here,

00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:28.597
you'd be rollin' in participants
willin' to stay at this tacky hotel.

00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:31.099
Haha! Never going to happen!

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.105
Angel, I appreciate
you wanting to use your special skills

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:38.648
to, um, attract folks to
the hotel,

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:44.613
but... I really don't want
to exploit you, in that way!

00:06:44.614 --> 00:06:47.407
Oh, please, baby.

00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:50.201
This body was made
to be exploited.

00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:53.955
I got the arms,
I got the stamina, I got the legs.

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:57.708
I got the lung capacity...
Oh-oh I got the legs,

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.753
the gag reflex, the holes...

00:06:59.754 --> 00:07:01.943
the chest fluff everyone thinks are tits

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:04.133
Uhhh, hold that
thought. I'll be right back!

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:06.634
I could keep goin'
all night, baby.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:11.639
Hello? Dad?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.079
Hey, I have a question.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.550
If freaky face over there
is so powerful,

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.022
then why can't
he just make people stay here?

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:21.837
Oh, trust me,
I can!

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.652
Why do you think I'm here?

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.155
You actually think I'd be cleaning bottles

00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:30.951
and listening to you fuck's bitch and
moan all the time if he wasn't forcin' me?

00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:33.871
- I like being forced.
- Keep that to yourself, Niff.

00:07:33.872 --> 00:07:37.165
What, you don't love being
here with me, Whiskers?

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:40.752
Call me "Whiskers" again and
I'll jam that bottle down your throat.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:44.922
Kinky. C'mon keep talkin' dirty.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:49.511
Ugh, Angel, let Husk do his job.
And no, we can't force sinners to stay here.

00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:51.179
They need to choose to.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.807
I'm choosing to be here,
and I think it's all stupid.

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:56.017
We're in Hell, Toots.

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:57.686
That's kind of the end of the
road, ain't it?

00:07:57.687 --> 00:07:59.187
Well, maybe it doesn't
have to be.

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:00.856
Just because nobody has made it
out before

00:08:00.857 --> 00:08:02.690
doesn't mean it's
not possible.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:06.695
Hey, whatever means I can keep
crashin' here rent free.

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:07.988
Crack is expensive.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.199
Yeah, I can totally.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.119
Yeah, I'll head over there
right away...

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.829
Okay.

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:20.875
Hah! YES! YES!! Hahahaha!!

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.003
- Vaggie! Holy shit!
- Ahh! What?!

00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:24.213
Get over here!

00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:28.050
What's going on?

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.928
My dad
just called. He said that the leader

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:32.595
of the Angel Army
wants to meet.

00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:34.890
- He asked if I could go instead.
- But...

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.238
But... But the extermination
just happened.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:40.562

Hello?

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:43.787
Hello?

00:11:43.788 --> 00:11:45.914
Creepy...

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.378
Oh, Okay. Also creepy.

00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:57.843
Uhh, hello?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.928
Is anyone here?

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.681
- 'Sup.
- Holy Shit!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:07.018
Hi, I'm Charlie. My dad
asked me if I could meet you.

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:11.106
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

00:12:11.107 --> 00:12:13.108
Totally. Nice to meet you, too.

00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:15.109
Ohh!

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.112
Ha! I fucking got you.
Did you fuckin' see that?

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:22.159
- Good shit.
- Uh, so wait, you aren't here?

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.201
No, you think I'd come
down there?

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.872
No. I mean, I love the vibe,
totally, I love your tunes.

00:12:26.873 --> 00:12:28.915
Pretty fuckin' hardcore,
don't get me wrong.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:31.125
But, it's such a bummer,
man.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.962
Everything down there's
just so "eugh" ya know?

00:12:33.963 --> 00:12:35.546
Ew.

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:39.967
Right. So I'm happy
we got this opportunity to meet.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:43.889
There's a project I've been working
on that I really want to talk to you about...

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.435
Hey, hey, hey, slow down. We
got time.

00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:51.146
How about we get to know
each other a little, mm?

00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:53.148
How about some lunch?
You hungry?

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:54.940
I got you!

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.319
Here's my personal favourite.
You'll love it.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.195
Uh, thanks!

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:03.283
I got you again, bitch!

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:05.994
Haha fuckin' hilarious! Haha!

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.457
Okay, so Charlie is
dealing with something very important,

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.334
so while she's gone,
we are making a new commercial.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:16.338
One that represents
her vision and what we're doing here.

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:19.841
So we need a camera. Alastor?

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.344
A video camera.

00:13:22.345 --> 00:13:23.845
Hmm?

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.180
All right, let's do this!

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.413
And...

00:13:29.414 --> 00:13:30.976
Action.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.230
" Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel

00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:35.105
Can I help you with anything?"

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.067
" I've been a bad boy.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:42.239
And I need a big, strong daddy
to put me in my place...

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.199
On the path to redemption."

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.163
- " Well, you come..."
- "Oh y es!"

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.207
"...To the right place."

00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:54.166
Cut.
Okay, Angel,

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.377
I need you to be less horny, if
possible.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.630
And Husk, can you maybe not
have a script in front of your face?

00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:00.423
I ain't no act.

00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:02.216
I can't memorize this shit.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:06.429
- Well, we could improv this shit.
- Baby cakes. Rawrrr.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.015
- Whoops.
- Husk, Come on.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.894
So I was playin' this
gig, and for some fuckin' reason

00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:15.146
this virtue chick was diggin' on the drummer,

00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.586
and it's like,
do you know who I am?

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:20.026
I'm fuckin' Adam.
I'm the original dick!

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.569
All dicks descend from me.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.573
You think you want drummer
dick? No way,

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:26.408
I'm the Dick-fuckin'
master!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.495
So anyway, then we fucked,
and it was awesome.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.642
What'd you do this
weekend?

00:14:32.643 --> 00:14:34.081
Wait, your name is Adam?

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.918
Like the first man Adam?
That means you...

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.086
Ohhh...

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.422
That explains so much.

00:14:40.423 --> 00:14:41.589
I know. I fucking rock.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.426
Well, Adam, sir. Mr. Adam, sir.

00:14:44.427 --> 00:14:46.260
Call me Dickmaster.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.013
Adam, you seem like a smart...

00:14:48.014 --> 00:14:49.638
well, stand up guy.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.390
Uh-huh.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.309
And I know you
are the leader of the angels.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.688
And you are a big thinker,
a revolutionary, a... a genius!

00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:58.564
I mean, your words, babe.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.983
Who would really love
to put his name on something.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.569
Fucking
love putting my name on shit.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.111
Shit's the best.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.072
It's a solution to our biggest
problem!

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:07.490
Oh, herpes.

00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.158
Yeah, that's a bitch.

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.994
No! Our other biggest problem.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.622
Oh, uh... ugly people?
Math?

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:16.458
Global warming?
Nah, wait that's Earth's problem.

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:18.375
Umm...

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.629
Hehehe. Stab. Stab. Stab.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.339
Alright Niffty.
Niffty? Niffty!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.217
Your line is
"We have the cleanest rooms."

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.303
- Okay?
- Got it. I'm ready.

00:15:28.304 --> 00:15:29.512
Action.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.105
Uhh... Cut.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.232
How was that?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.487
Well Niffty, you actually have
to say the line. So let's roll again.

00:15:45.488 --> 00:15:47.322
- Okay.
- Action.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.078
- You're doing great, Vagina.
- Cut!

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.332
Alright, um, maybe we can try
to fix it in post.

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.583
Do you even know
what that means?

00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:00.126
I'll figure it out.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.671
Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.635
Seems like you're
having a bit of trouble there, hm?

00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:11.638
Ugh, este pendejo... Why are you
even here?

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.430
For the entertainment!

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.558
I came here because I love
seeing wasteful souls

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.355
struggle to accomplish
something meaningful and fail spectacularly.

00:16:20.356 --> 00:16:22.190
Like you are doing now!

00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.524
Good Job!

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.088
And here is Alastor,

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:27.226
the egocentric piece
of shit that...

00:16:29.365 --> 00:16:31.365
I wouldn't try that my dear.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:34.619
This face was made for radio!

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.684
That's it!

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:39.665
I don't care who
or what you are.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.127
If you are staying here,
you are going to make this work.

00:16:42.128 --> 00:16:44.336
Because it won't be so
"entertaining"

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.215
to watch over an
empty hotel will it, shitass?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.614
Fair enough. I'll tell you what!

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:52.679
- Let's make a deal.
- Pft!

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.558
Do you think I'm that stupid?
Making a deal with a demon like you.

00:16:56.559 --> 00:17:00.186
Not for your soul,
just a simple deal.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:04.502
I do this for you, and you never
ask me to engage

00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:08.361
with this frivolous television
technology ever again.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.825
Or... Charlie can come
back to absolutely nothing!

00:17:13.826 --> 00:17:15.243
your choice.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:17.746
Fine.

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.087
Now then.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:37.432
Alright, everyone! Let's make a
fucking commercial.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.267
... When you take her out
for the fifth time

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.499
and she still expects you to pay
the check, but you're like,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.731
"Hey I thought you wanted equality"

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:47.192
No!
Our shared problem of

00:17:47.193 --> 00:17:48.234
overpopulation in Hell.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.489
Ohh! Well, that's not a problem!
We got that covered.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.532
Lute, how many
demons did you kill this year?

00:17:54.533 --> 00:17:56.618
Got a good 275 this year, sir.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:59.453
275?
Whoa, Badass!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.790
Awesome job, danger
tits! Pound it.

00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:03.832
Uh, no, not awesome.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.795
Those are my people,
you know that, right?

00:18:06.796 --> 00:18:08.546
Ohhh, yeah...

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.258
That must suck for you.
Hahahaha.

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:14.135
But these are souls.

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:18.306
Human souls, just the same as
the ones you have up in Heaven.

00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:19.807
They are not the same.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.810
They had their chance and
they earned damnation.

00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:23.143
You're wrong.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.937
Sinners made mistakes, sure,

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.772
but everyone makes mistakes.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.608
Angels don't make mistakes.

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:30.151
You really think that?

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:31.777
I know that.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.154
Yeah, I've never made a mistake
in my fuckin' life

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.698
The only reason you're still here

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:38.243
is because Daddy gave you
and your Hellborn-kind

00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:39.868
a pardon from an exorcist blade.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:43.248
How does that feel?
To know how little you matter.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.836
Oops, almost out of time.
Guess we should get into it...

00:18:47.837 --> 00:18:49.294
Oh! Fuck!

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.674
I've got a lot to get through.
and not a lot of time.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.844

from the Heaven Embassy

that the next extermination is
happening sooner than ever before.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:58.484

They've never managed
to kill one of us before.

We should just go
down there now and destroy them.

No, no. We can't risk
them catching on.

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.596

don't worry, when we come back,

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:31.684

alive to pull a stunt like this again!
